- Server prints PID
- Client takes two parameters:
	- server PID
	- string to send
- Client sends a string to server
- Once the string has been received, the server prints it and returns confirmation to client.

- The communication between client and server has to be done only using
UNIX signals.
- You can only use these two signals: SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2.
